# hello-world
Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. This project is just a simple exercise introducing GitHub. 

Nick here! I am just an amature programmer and intermediate engineer who is interested in learning
more about computer science and further developing health care related tech. Also, on the side, various 
projects that I find interesting or pertant to my own life. I plan to utilize GitHub as a way to track 
and store my current project data and files as well as a public form to collaborate on other projects, 
gain insight on my own and advance my learning process along the way.
